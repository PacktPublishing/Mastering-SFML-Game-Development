# Mastering SFML Game Development

This is the code repository for [Mastering SFML Game Development](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/mastering-sfml-game-development?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786469885),published by Packt.It contains all the supporting
project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

##About the book
This book will help you become an expert of SFML by using all of its features to its full potential. It begins by going over some of the foundational code necessary in order to make our RPG project run. By the end of chapter 3, we will have successfully picked up and deployed a fast and efficient particle system that makes the game look much more ‘alive’. Throughout the next couple of chapters, you will be successfully editing the game maps with ease, all thanks to the custom tools we’re going to be building. From this point on, it’s all about making the game look good. After being introduced to the use of shaders and raw OpenGL, you will be guided through implementing dynamic scene lighting, the use of normal and specular maps, and dynamic soft shadows. However, no project is complete without being optimized first. The very last chapter will wrap up our project by making it lightning fast and efficient.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders.Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name.
The commands and instructions will look like the following:

    class Observer{ 
    public: 
    virtual ~Observer(){} 
    virtual void Notify(const Message& l_message) = 0; 
    };
